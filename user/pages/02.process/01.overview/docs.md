There are many more pages and definitions of **Process** in the software world than I would care to go into.  But as an overview there are some things that are not clear to a lot of people. Let's call these "caveats".

1. Process is not **procedure**
2. Process is **descriptive** not proscriptive
3. Process is not a dirty word - despite the reaction it garners in general conversations

So, what is process then?  How do you define it, and what is a good process vs a bad process?

####Let's start with that first question, "what is process?".####

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a Process is:  
1. A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end:  
   _military operations could jeopardize the peace process_   
2. A natural series of changes:  
    *the ageing process*  
3. A systematic series of mechanized or chemical operations that are performed in order to produce something:  
    *the manufacturing process is relatively simple*  
4. Computing :: An instance of a program being executed in a multitasking operating system, typically running in an environment that protects it from other processes.  

So - that all seems pretty innocuous, right? So why is it so hard to define "Process" in the Software world?  Well, it really boils down to the fact that there are a lot of differing methodologies designed to make a given company's process robust.  External factors have a lot to play, too - Customers want to know how we guarantee the delivery of our product.  This means they want to know what the Process is around getting a feature to market, so that they can better understand timescales etc.

So, moving on to the second question:

####"How do you define [your] Process?"####

This really hinges on point 2 of the caveats above.  

2. Process is **descriptive** not proscriptive

This truly means that the best way to define the process that you are using is to describe what actually happens. And by that I do not mean "We use SCRUM."  I mean that we have to go back to basics and ask questions:

1. How do we capture customer requirements?  [who, what, when]
2. How do we prioritize those requirements?  [who, what, when]
3. How do we pass the requirements to engineering? [who, what, when]
.
.
.

Only when you have that description down you have a definition of your process.  This is where the fun begins.  Taking a leaf out of [LEAN Principles](http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm) "eliminate whenever possible those steps that do not add value".  We can start to tweak the process.  Now, value is an interesting problem in itself - what has value for an engineer may not have value for the business and vice-versa, and this doesn't include any layers of management, stakeholders, interested parties etc. And we will delve into that elsewhere within this manual.

So - now we have a definition of our process, we know what process is, let's try and move on to the last one

####What is a Good vs Bad Process####

You aren't going to want to hear this, but there is no such thing as a bad process. There is only a bad process **for you** (read: your organization etc.).  It is manifest that in an age of rapidly changing, continuously delivered products, process methodologies such as [PRINCE2](https://www.prince2.com/usa/prince2-processes) are too heavyweight for **most** organizations.  That doesn't make it a bad process, it just means it is incorrectly applied (and a note here - process is descriptive, not proscriptive, so "applying a process" is often a bad idea in the software world).  

Here's what makes a **Good** process:
The process accurately maps how you perform your work (deliver your code to the customer) and is efficient as possible without compromising business requirements.  In other words your process correctly ["Maps the Value Stream"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping)

We will discuss details of this overview in later posts, and dig into much more on definition, usage, adjustment and what makes a good process for an organization.
