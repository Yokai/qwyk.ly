### Quick and Handy Guides for Implementation

This Blog touches on many things in the DevOps world - not just tooling, but also culture, philosophy, collaboration and buy-in.

This Section will collect mini "How-To" documents and Cheat Sheets for setting up a successful DevOps oriented organization, along with how to implement some of the techniques and tooling in already established teams and companies.

Examples would be "How to tell if your organization is DevOps ready", "How to prioritize the move effectively", "How to prove Continuous Delivery works" etc.
