# Managing DevOps, Process, and Culture  
### Real World Lessons

With the term DevOps hitting the Peak of Inflated Expectations ([Gartner's Hype Cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp)), it has become apparent that there are some real world lessons to be learned to try and minimize our trough of disillusionment.

There are myriad blogs out there dealing with DevOps and they already cover the vast majority of topics that concern us. However, the migration of a startup to an enterprise, and the inevitable* change in culture and process that seems to follow is often overlooked.

This blog is, as you can tell, written from the point of view that a manual or runbook to refer to in dealing with actual issues is largely a more helpful resource than just the latest thought that popped into the author's mind.  As we continue our journey with Continuous Delivery, DevOps Kungfu, Process Management, Squad-style teams, then I will attempt to illustrate the issues and solutions that I have found to be useful.  

The objective is to have a resource that will be useful to all who deal with DevOps Management, whether you are a VP of engineering, a Project or Program Manager, or a brand-new freshly minted SRE.  There will I hope be some Technical Information around products and processes (think [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) or [Chef Delivery](https://www.chef.io/delivery/)) but the majority of information here will be about the Soft Problems that we all face.
